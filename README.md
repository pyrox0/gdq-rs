# GDQ_rs

A library for interacting with the [Games Done Quick Donation Tracker](https://github.com/gamesdonequick/donation-tracker) API.

Note: This library only supports the v2 api(available under `/api/v2/`), which is the only API implementation available as of Feb 26, 2025.
(See <https://github.com/GamesDoneQuick/donation-tracker/pull/796>)
Therefore, if your instance is not reasonably up-to-date, I make no guarantee that this library will work with it. I fairly closely track GDQ main, but try to maintain compatibility to the best of my ability.

If you would like this library to support V1, a feature from a fork you run, or to include support for a deprecated thing your tracker fork has, please support me! You can click the spon
